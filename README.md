# Streaming Sentiment
#### Shan Lu - Insight Data Engineering (Silicon Valley 2020)
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a real-time sentiment analysis platform for any real time JSON format data source. In this project, Twitter dataset is used to simulate the real-time sentiment analysis process.

## Problem Statement
For business, if someone was talking about you or your brand, you need to know what the consumers are saying about your business and your competitors. For advertisers, if you are going to post an advertisement at a specific time or location, you may also want to know the potentional audience's feelings. The applications of sentiment analysis in business cannot be overlooked. 

## Solution Statement
So, what is the solution? How do we build a real time platform that can provide sentiment analysis for different topics and different tags at real time? Also, you can figure out people's sentiment at that moment. There are hundereds of social media applications. For example, there are more than 1.3 million users on twitter, and there are more than 6000 tweets appearing per second. Then we will use these data as a source to the platform and deliver continuous information on a dynamic web page for business and advertisement decision making.
